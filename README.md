# 2024 DIRECTED FIELDWORK
My name is Penny Sun, a second-year Master of Library and Information Science student at the University of Washington, Seattle. This page documents my directed fieldwork for the spring quarter of 2024. I am doing Chinese materials cataloging with the UW Library. My work involves performing descriptive, subject, and genre/form cataloging and classification of various types of monographs. I apply Resource Description and Access, LC-PCC Policy Statements, Library of Congress classification, Library of Congress subject headings and genre/form terms, and OCLC MARC in my cataloging endeavors.
